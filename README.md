<h1>Flood It Game Clone</h1>

 ### [Video Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
This project replicates the web-based game "Flood It," which can be found at <a href="https://unixpapa.com/floodit/">this link</a>.
The size and number of colors used in a given game can be manipulated within the main method, and the allotted number of steps the user
is limited to is based off of these inputs. The fundamental gameplay as well as the "flooding" animation were both reconstructed in this
project without the use of any source code.

<h2>External Dependencies</h2>
The JAR files contained in the `Reference_Libraries` directory must first be installed as dependencies
so that the program may compile.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Java</b> 

<h2>Environments Used</h2>

- <b>Eclipse</b>
